## Usage

1. Install the package via composer:
    ```shell
    composer require laravel-notification-channels/authy
    ```

2. If you don't have the following lines already, add it to your `config/services.php` file, before the end of the array:

    ```php
    'authy' => [
        'mode' => env('AUTHY_MODE'),
        'keys' => [
            'production' => env('AUTHY_PRODUCTION_KEY'),
            'sandbox' => env('AUTHY_SANDBOX_KEY'),
        ],
    ],
    ```

3. If you haven't already: Register an [Authy](https://www.authy.com) account -> Sign in -> Access [dashboard](https://dashboard.authy.com) -> Create new application -> Copy your API keys (you've two keys, one for production & another for testing/sandbox)

4. If you don't have the following lines already, add it to your project's `.env` file, at the end:

    ```ini
    AUTHY_MODE=production
    AUTHY_PRODUCTION_KEY=AuthyProductionKeyHere
    AUTHY_SANDBOX_KEY=AuthySandboxKeyHere
    ```

    > **Note:** make sure to replace `AuthyProductionKeyHere` & `AuthySandboxKeyHere` with your keys from the previous step.

5. To route Authy notifications to the proper entity, define a `routeNotificationForAuthy` method on your notifiable entity. This should return the **Authy Id** to which the notification should be sent. Example:

    ```php
    /**
     * Route notifications for the authy channel.
     *
     * @return int
     */
    public function routeNotificationForAuthy()
    {
        return $this->authy_id;
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** as you might thought, this requires an `authy_id` attribute in your notifiable entity, for which you may need to create an additional field in the database table.

6. Now you can create notifications that use Authy channel as follows:

    ```php
    // app/Notifications/PhoneVerificationNotification.php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
    use NotificationChannels\Authy\AuthyChannel;
    use NotificationChannels\Authy\AuthyMessage;

    class PhoneVerificationNotification extends Notification
    {
        /**
         * The notification method (sms/call).
         *
         * @var string
         */
        public $method;
    
        /**
         * Determine whether to force the notification over cellphone network.
         *
         * @var bool
         */
        public $force;
    
        /**
         * The notification message action.
         *
         * @var string
         */
        public $action;
    
        /**
         * The notification message action message.
         *
         * @var string
         */
        public $actionMessage;
    
        /**
         * Create a notification instance.
         *
         * @param string $method
         * @param bool   $force
         * @param string $action
         * @param string $actionMessage
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct($method = 'sms', $force = false, $action = null, $actionMessage = null)
        {
            $this->method = $method;
            $this->force = $force;
            $this->action = $action;
            $this->actionMessage = $actionMessage;
        }
    
        /**
         * Get the notification's channels.
         *
         * @param mixed $notifiable
         *
         * @return array|string
         */
        public function via($notifiable)
        {
            return [AuthyChannel::class];
        }
    
        /**
         * Build the Authy representation of the notification.
         *
         * @return \NotificationChannels\Authy\AuthyMessage
         */
        public function toAuthy()
        {
            $message = AuthyMessage::create()->method($this->method);
    
            if ($this->force) {
                $message->force();
            }

            if ($this->action) {
                $message->action($action);
            }

            if ($this->actionMessage) {
                $message->actionMessage($actionMessage);
            }

            return $message;
        }
    }
    ```

7. Finally you can consume the notification as follows:

    ```php
    $this->notify(new \App\Notifications\PhoneVerificationNotification('sms', true));
    ```

    > **Note:** don't forget to read through [Authy TOTP API](https://docs.authy.com/totp.html) documentation for further information.

8. Done!
